- Alter commands to fit with my GTD keywords and emacs style shortcuts in dired etc:
  - 'q' instead of 'x' for quitting
    - Elimination of "quick action" (I don't need a )
  - 'd' instead of 't' for deleting things
  - 'w' instead of 'd' for delegation/waiting
    - If you want to discriminate between "Delegated" items and "Waiting for" items, you could instatiate with 'g' for "DeleGation"
  - 'r' instead of 'a' for archiving/adding to reference cabinet
    - I understand archiving as distinct from reference material in that it's not meant for active use 
* NOTICE
This is org-gtd 2.0.0. 

Check documentation in [[doc/]] if you're upgrading. Please report all defects as Github issues.

Use existing tags if you'd rather stick to a pre-2.0 version.
* Org GTD
This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow.
This package assumes familiarity with GTD.

This package provides a system that allows you to capture incoming things into an inbox, then process the inbox and categorize each item based on the GTD categories.  It leverages org-agenda to show today's items as well as the NEXT items.  It also has a simple project management system, which currently assumes all tasks in a project are sequential.

For a comprehensive instruction manual, see the documentation.
Either the info file or in the [[doc/]] directory of the repository.
Upgrade information is also available therein.

* Community
If you want help, you can open an issue right on Github.

You're also welcome to join my [[https://discord.gg/9UAXpCaVJb][discord server]] for all conversations related to org-gtd in particular and GTD in general. Many of the ideas for org-gtd came out of my reading the GTD book, and then reading some sections multiple times, but I am in no way an expert. Defining the GTD domain, which is to say, getting to clear nomenclature with clear actions, is still a work in progress.
